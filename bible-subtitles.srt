And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
Luke 19:17

105
01:44:00,000 --> 01:45:00,000
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 
Luke 22:32

106
01:45:00,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. 
John 20:27

107
01:46:00,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 3:16

108
01:47:00,000 --> 01:48:00,000
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 
Acts (of the Apostles) 6:5

109
01:48:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 6:7

110
01:49:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 6:8

111
01:50:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 11:24

112
01:51:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 13:8

113
01:52:00,000 --> 01:53:00,000
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:9

114
01:53:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Confirming the souls of the disciples, [and] exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:22

115
01:54:00,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:27

116
01:55:00,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 15:9

117
01:56:00,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 16:5

118
01:57:00,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought [us,] saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there.] And she constrained us. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 16:15

119
01:58:00,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 20:21

120
01:59:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 24:24

121
02:00:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 26:18

122
02:01:00,000 --> 02:02:00,000
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
Romans 1:5

123
02:02:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
Romans 1:8

124
02:03:00,000 --> 02:04:00,000
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
Romans 1:12

125
02:04:00,000 --> 02:05:00,000
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 
Romans 1:17

126
02:05:00,000 --> 02:06:00,000
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
Romans 3:3

127
02:06:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
Romans 3:22

128
02:07:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
Romans 3:25

129
02:08:00,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Romans 3:27

130
02:09:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
Romans 3:28

131
02:10:00,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
Romans 3:30

132
02:11:00,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. 
Romans 3:31

133
02:12:00,000 --> 02:13:00,000
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
Romans 4:5

134
02:13:00,000 --> 02:14:00,000
[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only,] or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
Romans 4:9

135
02:14:00,000 --> 02:15:00,000
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
Romans 4:11

136
02:15:00,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised. 
Romans 4:12

137
02:16:00,000 --> 02:17:00,000
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
Romans 4:13

138
02:17:00,000 --> 02:18:00,000
For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
Romans 4:14

139
02:18:00,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
Romans 4:16

140
02:19:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
Romans 4:19

141
02:20:00,000 --> 02:21:00,000
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
Romans 4:20

142
02:21:00,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Romans 5:1

143
02:22:00,000 --> 02:23:00,000
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
Romans 5:2

144
02:23:00,000 --> 02:24:00,000
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
Romans 9:30

145
02:24:00,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
Romans 9:32

146
02:25:00,000 --> 02:26:00,000
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above:]) 
Romans 10:6

147
02:26:00,000 --> 02:27:00,000
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
Romans 10:8

148
02:27:00,000 --> 02:28:00,000
So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
Romans 10:17

149
02:28:00,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
Romans 11:20

150
02:29:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
Romans 12:3

151
02:30:00,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith; 
Romans 12:6

152
02:31:00,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations. 
Romans 14:1

153
02:32:00,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
Romans 14:22

154
02:33:00,000 --> 02:34:00,000
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin. 
Romans 14:23

155
02:34:00,000 --> 02:35:00,000
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
Romans 16:26

156
02:35:00,000 --> 02:36:00,000
God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Corinthians 1:9

157
02:36:00,000 --> 02:37:00,000
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
1 Corinthians 2:5

158
02:37:00,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1 Corinthians 4:2

159
02:38:00,000 --> 02:39:00,000
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
1 Corinthians 4:17

160
02:39:00,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1 Corinthians 7:25

161
02:40:00,000 --> 02:41:00,000
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it.] 
1 Corinthians 10:13

162
02:41:00,000 --> 02:42:00,000
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
1 Corinthians 12:9

163
02:42:00,000 --> 02:43:00,000
And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
1 Corinthians 13:2

164
02:43:00,000 --> 02:44:00,000
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity. 
1 Corinthians 13:13

165
02:44:00,000 --> 02:45:00,000
And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain. 
1 Corinthians 15:14

166
02:45:00,000 --> 02:46:00,000
And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
1 Corinthians 15:17

167
02:46:00,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1 Corinthians 16:13

168
02:47:00,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
2 Corinthians 1:24

169
02:48:00,000 --> 02:49:00,000
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
2 Corinthians 4:13

170
02:49:00,000 --> 02:50:00,000
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
2 Corinthians 5:7

171
02:50:00,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also. 
2 Corinthians 8:7

172
02:51:00,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is,] of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
2 Corinthians 10:15

173
02:52:00,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
2 Corinthians 13:5

174
02:53:00,000 --> 02:54:00,000
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
Galatians 1:23

175
02:54:00,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
Galatians 2:16

176
02:55:00,000 --> 02:56:00,000
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
Galatians 2:20

177
02:56:00,000 --> 02:57:00,000
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:2

178
02:57:00,000 --> 02:58:00,000
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:5

179
02:58:00,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
Galatians 3:7

180
02:59:00,000 --> 03:00:00,000
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
Galatians 3:8

181
03:00:00,000 --> 03:01:00,000
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
Galatians 3:9

182
03:01:00,000 --> 03:02:00,000
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
Galatians 3:11

183
03:02:00,000 --> 03:03:00,000
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
Galatians 3:12

184
03:03:00,000 --> 03:04:00,000
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
Galatians 3:14

185
03:04:00,000 --> 03:05:00,000
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
Galatians 3:22

186
03:05:00,000 --> 03:06:00,000
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
Galatians 3:23

187
03:06:00,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
Galatians 3:24

188
03:07:00,000 --> 03:08:00,000
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
Galatians 3:25

189
03:08:00,000 --> 03:09:00,000
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
Galatians 3:26

190
03:09:00,000 --> 03:10:00,000
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
Galatians 5:5

191
03:10:00,000 --> 03:11:00,000
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
Galatians 5:6

192
03:11:00,000 --> 03:12:00,000
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
Galatians 5:22

193
03:12:00,000 --> 03:13:00,000
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
Galatians 6:10

194
03:13:00,000 --> 03:14:00,000
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Ephesians 1:1

195
03:14:00,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
Ephesians 1:15

196
03:15:00,000 --> 03:16:00,000
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 
Ephesians 2:8

197
03:16:00,000 --> 03:17:00,000
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
Ephesians 3:12

198
03:17:00,000 --> 03:18:00,000
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
Ephesians 3:17

199
03:18:00,000 --> 03:19:00,000
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
Ephesians 4:5

200
03:19:00,000 --> 03:20:00,000
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
Ephesians 4:13

201
03:20:00,000 --> 03:21:00,000
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
Ephesians 6:16

202
03:21:00,000 --> 03:22:00,000
But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
Ephesians 6:21

203
03:22:00,000 --> 03:23:00,000
Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ephesians 6:23

204
03:23:00,000 --> 03:24:00,000
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
Philippians 1:25

205
03:24:00,000 --> 03:25:00,000
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
Philippians 1:27

206
03:25:00,000 --> 03:26:00,000
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
Philippians 2:17

207
03:26:00,000 --> 03:27:00,000
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
Philippians 3:9

208
03:27:00,000 --> 03:28:00,000
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Colossians 1:2

209
03:28:00,000 --> 03:29:00,000
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints, 
Colossians 1:4

210
03:29:00,000 --> 03:30:00,000
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
Colossians 1:7

211
03:30:00,000 --> 03:31:00,000
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
Colossians 1:23

212
03:31:00,000 --> 03:32:00,000
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
Colossians 2:5

213
03:32:00,000 --> 03:33:00,000
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Colossians 2:7

214
03:33:00,000 --> 03:34:00,000
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
Colossians 2:12

215
03:34:00,000 --> 03:35:00,000
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 
Colossians 4:7

216
03:35:00,000 --> 03:36:00,000
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here. 
Colossians 4:9

217
03:36:00,000 --> 03:37:00,000
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
1 Thessalonians 1:3

218
03:37:00,000 --> 03:38:00,000
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
1 Thessalonians 1:8

219
03:38:00,000 --> 03:39:00,000
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:2

220
03:39:00,000 --> 03:40:00,000
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
1 Thessalonians 3:5

221
03:40:00,000 --> 03:41:00,000
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you: 
1 Thessalonians 3:6

222
03:41:00,000 --> 03:42:00,000
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:7

223
03:42:00,000 --> 03:43:00,000
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
1 Thessalonians 3:10

224
03:43:00,000 --> 03:44:00,000
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1 Thessalonians 5:8

225
03:44:00,000 --> 03:45:00,000
Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it.] 
1 Thessalonians 5:24

226
03:45:00,000 --> 03:46:00,000
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
2 Thessalonians 1:3

227
03:46:00,000 --> 03:47:00,000
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
2 Thessalonians 1:4

228
03:47:00,000 --> 03:48:00,000
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
2 Thessalonians 1:11

229
03:48:00,000 --> 03:49:00,000
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith. 
2 Thessalonians 3:2

230
03:49:00,000 --> 03:50:00,000
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil. 
2 Thessalonians 3:3

231
03:50:00,000 --> 03:51:00,000
Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Timothy 1:2

232
03:51:00,000 --> 03:52:00,000
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do. ] 
1 Timothy 1:4

233
03:52:00,000 --> 03:53:00,000
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned: 
1 Timothy 1:5

234
03:53:00,000 --> 03:54:00,000
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
1 Timothy 1:12

235
03:54:00,000 --> 03:55:00,000
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 1:14

236
03:55:00,000 --> 03:56:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
1 Timothy 1:15

237
03:56:00,000 --> 03:57:00,000
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
1 Timothy 1:19

238
03:57:00,000 --> 03:58:00,000
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
1 Timothy 2:7

239
03:58:00,000 --> 03:59:00,000
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. 
1 Timothy 2:15
